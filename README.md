# Subway-Cheese-Chase
Subway Cheese Chase is Andrew Partin, Joshua Bryant, and I's MakeUC Hackathon project

In the world's eeriest digital twin of Subway, a lone sandwich artist is chased by a monster. On his break he dropped his keys to his hot pink Camaro and must use cheese to survive or die trying.
